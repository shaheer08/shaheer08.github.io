_It's a time to learn "How to Make Almost Anything!"_
_We had a great Session About What is Fab lab and Convinced us "How to Make Almost Anything"_.
_We got an idea about How to Document our Work Properly and had a session about Github Page creation._


### What is Fab lab ?
_A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make "almost anything". This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production._
### Do you Know Who is  Neil Gershenfeld?
_Neil A. Gershenfeld (born 1959 or 1960) is an American professor at MIT and the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab. His research studies are predominantly focused in interdisciplinary studies involving physics and computer science, in such fields as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and personal fabrication.He is Considered As Father Of FAB LAB._
